VideoWall - Ruby on Rails
======================================

Lightweight Ruby on Rails and MySQL application for creating asynchronous HTML5-video based collaborative learning spaces

## About

Interested in developing HTML5-video based asynchronous collaborative learning spaces, interested in building sign language learning applications, VideoWall will get you started using Ruby on Rails and MySQL

## Lightweight

I have deliberately tried to keep the application as bare bones as possible to allow rapid development, schema, models, views and controllers are pretty basic and there is very little CSS/JavaScript but I have added a light Bootstrap touch for styling

## Platform

[rubyonrails.org](http://rubyonrails.org/)
